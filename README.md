# Bot that sends images of cats and dogs :dog: :smiley_cat:
This is my first Telegram bot that sends random images of cats and dogs.

In order to start the bot do the following:
* clone this repository;
* ensure that you installed telebot. If not, install it using the following command: **`pip3 install pyTelegramBotAPI`**;
* run the program using command **./cat_dog_bot.py**;
* go to Telegram, find bot (**@thi_is_bot**);
* to run Bot type command '/start'. You will see welcome sticker and offer to make your choise.

Aaaand here we are! Enjoy pics of cute and funny cats&dogs.
